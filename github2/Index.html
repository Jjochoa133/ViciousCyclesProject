            <P>As gas prices rise in this day and age, public transit and riding your two-wheeler around seem to be the better, cheaper alternatives. We've got solutions for you here at Vicious Cycles with our customization services that will cater to your specific needs and wants from coloring the frames, to customizing the bike seat to make your tush as comfortable as possible for those long-winded rides along the coast. You can select from an existing bike type, or just go wild and mix it up; make a crazy-looking hybrid. We can do that for you, too!
